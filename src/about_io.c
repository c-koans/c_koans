    This series of koans will go over topics not entirely specific to the C
    language itself, but is an essential topic for writing more-than-trivial
    C programs: IO. It is recommended to do the about_printing koan prior to
    this one.

    As IO is fairly environment specific, this koan will only go over the
    standard IO library that is supported by all platforms.

    It will be referred to as stdio, after the header file <stdio.h>

	Every write is first written to a buffer in memory before it is written
	to the stream, and is instead all written together in one big write at
	a later time. Since IO is expensive, reducing the number of times these
	operations are done saves quite a bit of time.

	Reads on the other hand are done in large chunks, so reading from a
	stream will be reading from a buffer in memory.

	To send what's in the buffer to the stream without waiting, stdio has
	a function fflush that will "flush" a stream's buffer.
