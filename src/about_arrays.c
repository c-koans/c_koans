        An important operator in C is sizeof:
        The unary operator sizeof generates the size of a variable or datatype,
        measured in the number of char size storage units required for the type.
        As such, the construct sizeof (char) is guaranteed to be 1. The actual
        number of bits of type char is specified by the preprocessor macro
        CHAR_BIT, defined in the header file limits.h. On most modern systems
        this is eight bits. The result has an unsigned integral type that is
        usually denoted by size_t. The operator is written preceding its
        operand, and may be applied either to a variable or any data type
        specification, including primitive types such as integer and
        floating-point types, pointer types, or compound datatypes (unions,
        structs). When applied to a data type the type must be enclosed in
        parenthesis.
