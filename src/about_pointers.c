        Function pointers are a tricky notion to handle for beginner C
        programmers, but with a little practice you should be able to understand
        how they work.

        To display function pointers, we will examine the usage of the C stdlib
        function qsort, quicksort.

        To start, we will examine the function prototype for qsort:

        void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size,
                    int (*compar)(const void *, const void *));

        base: This is your array.
        nmemb: This is the number of elements in your array.
        size: This is the size of each element in your array.
        compar: This is the function pointer for the comparison function

        Now, compar itself has a very tricky declaration, and we will dissect
        it.

        int (*compar)(const void *, const void *)

        In plain English, this declaration means: "A pointer to a function that
        takes two const void pointers as arguments, and returns an int"

        The key to the declaration is (*compar). This signifies that this is a
        function pointer. If *compar was not in parens, compar would be read by
        the compiler as a pointer to an int. With them, it is read as a function
        that returns an int.

        The next key is the (const void *, const void *). This signifies the
        arguments of the function being pointed to.

        To test your knowledge, you will now write the line of code to call
        qsort to sort the array declared earlier. We have provided a comparison
        function for strings that can be used by qsort.
    */

    /*
        Write the line of code to sort names here.
        the comparison function to use can be found found in c_koans_helpers.c,
        named string_compare
    */

    /* qsort(); */

    cr_assert_arr_eq_cmp(sorted_names, names, array_size, string_compare,
        "The names are not sorted.");
}
